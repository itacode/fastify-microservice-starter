# Fastify Microservice Starter

It's a boilerplate to start developing a microservice with Fastify.

## Features

- Fastify
- TypeScript
- Multiple .env files
- Node.js native watch
- ESLint
- Jest
- Docker configuration
- Docker-compose configuration

## Platform and Environment Variables

### Platform

**Platform** is a way to specify an environment file to be loaded by `dotenv`.  
The application determines the configuration profile by checking variables in this order:
1. `PLATFORM`
2. `NODE_ENV`
3. Default: `production`

For example, if you run `npm run dev` (which sets `NODE_ENV=development`), `.env.development` will be loaded automatically. You can override this by setting `PLATFORM` explicitly (e.g., `PLATFORM=staging`).

### Environment Variables

You can specify env variables by placing the following files in your project root:

```shell
.env.[platform].local # only loaded in specified platform, ignored by git
.env.[platform]       # only loaded in specified platform
.env.local            # loaded in all cases but not test, ignored by git
.env                  # loaded in all cases
```

#### Env Loading Priorities

An env file for a specific platform (e.g. .env.production) will take higher priority than a generic one (e.g. .env).  
This [convention](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv#what-other-env-files-can-i-use) has been adopted.
